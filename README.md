Intro to Python Assignment
Description

Instructions:

Basic Calculator Program

Create a simple Python program that asks the user to input two numbers and a mathematical operation (addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division).
Perform the operation based on the user's input and print the result.
Example: If a user inputs 10, 5, and +, your program should display 10 + 5 = 15.



Note: Upload the code to GitHub and submit the GitHub link

Objective

Practice creating Python programs to perform arithmetic and string, experimenting with variables, and exploring data types.

#Assignment Solution

âœ… How It Works:
- Takes two numbers as input from the user.
- Asks for an operation (+, -, *, /).
- Performs the operation based on user input.
- Handles division by zero with an error message.
- Prints the result in a readable format.

ðŸ›  Example Run:

Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 5
Enter an operation (+, -, *, /): +
10 + 5 = 15

ðŸ”¥ Now you can test and modify it to add more features, like exponentiation (**) or modulus (%)!
